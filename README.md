Iroh is inspired from [gruvbox](morhetz/gruvbox)

Iroh is a dark theme only theme supposed to look like a mix between volcanic and 
ceramic style. It was at first made in order to fit into a DOOM-theme rice. 
However, by making it functional, it lost a bit of that demonic vibe.
The source code, however, still implements more demonic names right now.

Also, that means I did not make the colorscheme based on Iroh from Avatar: 
The Last Airbender.
I only realized his looks were pretty similar to this theme after making it.
Originally, the theme would have been called Damien.
